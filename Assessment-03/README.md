# Assessment 03: Conditional Statements

## Objective

Learn how to use conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`) to control the flow of your program based on different conditions.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Assessment_03.cs`.
2. Write a C# program that:
   - Asks the user to input their age.
   - Prints different messages depending on the age range:
     - "You are a child" for ages 0-12.
     - "You are a teenager" for ages 13-19.
     - "You are an adult" for ages 20-64.
     - "You are a senior" for ages 65 and above.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c#
Enter your age: 25 You are an adult.
```

## Skills Covered

- Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Implementing `switch-case` for handling multiple conditions.
