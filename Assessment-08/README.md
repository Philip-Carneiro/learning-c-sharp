# Assessment 08: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Objective

Understand inheritance and polymorphism by creating a base class and derived classes, and by overriding methods.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Assessment_08.cs`.
2. Write a C# program that:
   - Defines a base class `Animal` with a `Speak` method.
   - Creates derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override the `Speak` method.
   - Demonstrates polymorphism by calling `Speak` on an array of `Animal` objects.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c#
Dog says: Woof! Cat says: Meow!
```

## Skills Covered

- Understanding and implementing inheritance.
- Overriding methods in derived classes.
- Using polymorphism to write flexible and reusable code.
