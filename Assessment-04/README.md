# Assessment 04: Loops

## Objective

Understand how to use loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `foreach`) to repeat actions multiple times based on conditions.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Assessment_04.cs`.
2. Write a C# program that:
   - Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
   - Prints numbers from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop.
   - Continuously asks the user for a number until they enter a negative number using a `do-while` loop.
   - Iterates over an array of integers using a `foreach` loop.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c#
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Enter a number (negative to quit): 5 Enter a number (negative to quit): -1 Goodbye! Array: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Skills Covered

- Implementing `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `foreach` loops.
- Loop control and termination.
- Iterating through arrays and collections.
