# Assessment 02: Variables and Data Types

## Objective

In this assessment, you'll learn to declare and use variables of different data types, and perform basic arithmetic operations. This will help you understand data types, variables, and operators in C#.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Assessment_02.cs`.
2. Write a C# program that:
   - Declares variables of different types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `string`, `bool`).
   - Assigns values to these variables and performs basic arithmetic operations.
   - Prints the results to the console.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c#
Integer: 10 Double: 5.5 String: Hello Boolean: True Sum: 15.5
```

## Skills Covered

- Declaring and using variables of different data types.
- Using arithmetic and string operators.
- Basic input/output in C#.
