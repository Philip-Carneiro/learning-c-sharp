# Assessment 05: Methods

## Objective

Learn how to define and use methods to modularize your code, make it more readable, and avoid repetition.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `Assessment_05.cs`.
2. Write a C# program that:
   - Defines three methods: `Add(int a, int b)`, `Subtract(int a, int b)`, and `Multiply(int a, int b)`.
   - Calls these methods with user-provided inputs and prints the results.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c#
Enter two integers: 4 2 4 + 2 = 6 4 - 2 = 2 4 * 2 = 8
```

## Skills Covered

- Method declaration and definition.
- Method calling and passing arguments.
- Returning values from methods.
